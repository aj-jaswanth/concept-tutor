	<intro> Most of the work in the industries is done manually.  Only the big industries have generator backup, but that is also  not sufficient. 
 The village gets electricity only for 2 to 3 hrs in  a day.  It is very difficult in the night to do any work. There have been many instances when wild animals have come to the village in the night and the villages have become their prey. 
Due to the lack of the electricity the village is not able to avail of  most of the modern facilities such as e- ticketing, e- banking.  Todays Gram Sabha is going to address this as one of its issues.
